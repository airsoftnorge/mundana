		For the purposes of airsoft, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Team_Awareness_Kit">Team Awareness Kit (TAK)</a> is a software suite capable of supporting mission planning and navigation, as well as communication and coordination between individuals, squads and entire teams on the airsoft field. <br>
		To facilitate the use of TAK in support of airsoft games in Norway, AirsoftNorge has set up the ASN-TAK infrastructure, consisting of three dedicated TAK servers for public use by airsofters across Norway. <br>
		<br>
		Through this, we hope to turn ASN-TAK into a fun and useful force multiplier for the scene as a whole, and especially for the particularly dedicated members of the community who take upon themselves the responsibility of arranging the airsoft games the rest of us love to take part in.
		<br>
		Should you have questions about ASN-TAK beyond what is found in this category, feel free to join <a href="https://discord.gg/gMegmXMAPN">our ASN Discord server</a>, where we have a dedicated channel for anything TAK-related.
