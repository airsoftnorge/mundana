The Norwegian airsoft community is dispersed through a series of facebook groups and discord servers. 
There are historic and geographical reasons for how they are distributed, resulting in a lot of overlap.

It's advised that you find a local club and join for a few games before you buy anything - as misbuys sadly are a very common, and quite often costly occurance. 
See our post on [what to consider before you buy](../before-you-buy) for more.

Use the links below to orient yourself as best as possible.
