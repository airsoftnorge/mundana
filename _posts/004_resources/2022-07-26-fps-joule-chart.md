Unsure what BB weight is right for you? Check out airsoftnorges [residual energy calculator](https://airsoftnorge.com/residual-energy-calculator/) that allows you to see how much energy is left in a BB after a given distance. 
Also consider if you need hits fast on short range or slower but more accurate shots at longer range. This will vary a lot by playstyle or fields.
