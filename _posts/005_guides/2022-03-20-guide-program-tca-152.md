#### This guide assumes you have both a functional programming cable and access to the TCA-152 software. 
Both can be found [here](http://www.px-airsoft.com/showroom/model/T0002/templateProductDetails.do?webId=1213907847691&editCurrentLanguage=1213907847692&module=SearchProduct&keyWords=programming&currentPage=1&ParentId=1324666353492015337&productId=1516938489906103430).
Inquire about the software on discord if you have a cable but no software.

#### Not all radios are identical so make sure you keep a backup of the original radio configuration!


* Connect the TCA 152 to your computer, open the TCA-152 software and turn on the radio.

* Select Program and download the current configuration from your radio:

* Once downloaded select Save as and save it as a backup.

* Make sure that options are set to what you need, 6.25khz is fine, 12,5khz is the normal step for norwegian radio channels:
