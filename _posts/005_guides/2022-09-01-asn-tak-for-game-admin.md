When hosting a big game the quality of info you are receiving tends to be questionable, inaccurate reporting of possitions to their team command, reported inaccurately back to the game admin.
Using TAK each side can solve their part in this, but as a game admin you need the full picture accross sides and simply connecting to all servers do not give you the team separation needed.

To solve this ASN offers to host dedicated game admin servers for events, where we federate the information from each team into a new server, where each team is colorcoded on the way in.


This is the view if on all servers:
Red and blue side is represented in this picture in addition to two game-admin assets.

		<img src="/assets/images/005_guides/2022-09-01-biggametak/chaosmap.png" width="640"/>
	</a>
</div>

Via the game-admin server you can see the people assigned their proper team colors. Red units are red, blue units are blue and game-admin assets are yellow.
