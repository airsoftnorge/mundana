When organizing larger airsoft games, the limited number of radio channels available in the Channel range is felt quickly.
For that reason, it's important to have a structure that is as condensed and functional as possible.
As a general rule you want leaders to have radio to their people and one level above in the command structure. Depending on the amount of channels available, as well as the number of players, this can either result in a platoon net or squad nets.

This is an example of a good setup for the limitation of the PMR446.
If you have access to additional VHF channels you should prioritize the emergency and command net and move them up. 


# Game Administrative Channels #


```
[ 446.00625 MHz ] - Channel 1 - **EMERGENCY** 
[ 446.10625 MHz ] - Channel 9 - Dedicated Game Administrative Channel
```

# Side A (Alpha Company) Channels #

```
[ 446.01875 MHz ] - Channel 2 - Side A Command Net
[ 446.03125 MHz ] - Channel 3 - Side A, QRF / Special Purpose
[ 446.04375 MHz ] - Channel 4 - Side A, Platoon 1
[ 446.05625 MHz ] - Channel 5 - Side A, Platoon 2
[ 446.06875 MHz ] - Channel 6 - Side A, Platoon 3
[ 446.08125 MHz ] - Channel 7 - Side A, Platoon 4
[ 446.09375 MHz ] - Channel 8 - Side A, Platoon 5
```

# Side B (Bravo Company) Channels #

```
[ 446.11875 MHz ] - Channel 10 - Side B Command Net
[ 446.13125 MHz ] - Channel 11 - Side B, QRF / Special Purpose
[ 446.14375 MHz ] - Channel 12 - Side B, Platoon 1
[ 446.15625 MHz ] - Channel 13 - Side B, Platoon 2
[ 446.16875 MHz ] - Channel 14 - Side B, Platoon 3
[ 446.18125 MHz ] - Channel 15 - Side B, Platoon 4
[ 446.19375 MHz ] - Channel 16 - Side B, Platoon 5
```


This structure then in turn, can be used to formulate the callsigns used on the respective sides' Command Net channels, in the following example, Side B (Bravo Company): 



# Side B Command Net Callsigns #

```
B9 - Bravo Company Command
B9.1 - Company Commander (Actual)
B9.2 - Company Second in Command (XO)
B9.4 - Company Logistics Officer
B9.3 - Company Signals Officer

B1 - B Coy. Platoon 1 Command
B1.1 - B Coy. Platoon 1 Commander (Actual)
B1.2 - B Coy. Platoon 1 Second in Command (XO)
B1.3 - B.Coy Platoon 1 Signals Officer

B2 - B Coy. Platoon 2 Command
B2.1 - B Coy. Platoon 2 Commander (Actual)
B2.2 - B Coy. Platoon 2 Second in Command (XO)
B2.3 - B Coy. Platoon 2 Signals Officer

B3 - B Coy. Platoon 3 Command
B3.1 - B Coy Platoon 3 Commander (Actual)
B3.2 - B Coy Platoon 3 Second in Command (XO)
B3.3 - B Coy Platoon 3 Signals Officer

B4 - B Coy. Platoon 4 Command
B4.1 - B Coy. Platoon 4 Commander (Actual)
B4.2 - B Coy. Platoon 4 Second in Command (XO)
B4.3 - B Coy. Platoon 4 Signals Officer

B5 - B Coy. QRF / Special Purpose Platoon Command
B5.1 B Coy. QRF / Special Purpose Platoon Commander (Actual)
B5.2 B Coy. QRF / Special Purpose Platoon Second in Command (XO)
B5.3 B Coy QRF / Special Purpose Platoon Signals Officer
```

On the platoon level nets, however, callsigns will shift one digit to the right - losing the signifier of what Company the Platoon belongs to, and picking up identifiers for the individual soldiers in the Platoon's Squads instead: 


# Side B (Bravo Coy.), 3rd Platoon Net Callsigns #

```
3.9 - Platoon 3 Command
3.9.1 - Platoon 3 Commander (Actual)
3.9.2 - Platoon 3 Second in Command (XO)
3.9.4 - Platoon 3 Logistics Assistant
3.9.3 - Platoon 3 Signals Operator

3.A - Alpha Squad
3.A.1 - Alpha Squad Leader
3.A.2 - Alpha Squad Second in Command
3.A.3 - 
```
