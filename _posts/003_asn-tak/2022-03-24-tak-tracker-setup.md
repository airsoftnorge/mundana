Before using any TAK software, please make yourself familiar with the products and the potential privacy implications. More info [here](/asn-tak-overview).


<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.tak.taktracker&hl=en&gl=US" target="_blank">TAK Tracker</a> is a less resource intensive app that allows you to passively feed location data into a TAK network of your choosing.
Unlike the ATAK app, it features no maps, messaging or interaction with data packages.
Despite these limited features, it could be useful for tracking individuals that do not have a need to actually interact actively with the TAK network, or if you have a spare *Android End User Device*, it could be used to track game objectives, vehicles or just about anything else you can think of.

You can install TAK Tracker by following the link above, or searching for "TAK Tracker" in the Google Play Store.


**Please keep in mind: When operating TAK Tracker, you should consider the same privacy aspects as we laid out in <a href="/introduction-to-atak/">our introductory article on ATAK</a> to maintain your personal security.**
